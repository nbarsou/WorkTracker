# WorkTracker
A program that runs in terminal (For now) that helps you track tasks and the time spent on them. This is also my first GitHub project, so if you have any recommendations or tips feel free to give them. Any feedback and interaction is welcomed! 

## Requirements  
    - Very light program to run in background
    - Easy to Use 
    - Fast to Use  
    - Intuative to use 

## TODO
    - Create a task
    - Create subtaks 
    - Time Track 
    - When done with a subtask register time of completion (While in time tracking mode, select the number of subtask then hit enter)
    - When done with time tracking (Enter some quick text describing what you did)

## Extra Functionality: 
    - General Stats 
    - Stats for each Categories / Projects  
    - Set workhours* 
    - Give Desktop Notifications 
    - Detect AFK 

    *Need to find a way to do this while keeping the program light
